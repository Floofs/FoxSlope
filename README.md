# FoxSlope

A proof-of-concept made in Game Maker Studio 2, to showcase that the 8-bit Sonic Physics can be replicated in GMS2 without much hassle.
Uses Sonic-like physics based partially on Sonic Retro's Sonic Physics Guide based on the 16-bit titles.

Of the four modes described in the "Slope Physics" section, this only includes the Floor mode - so it's not going to be perfect.
However, I have made the game automatically try to fling you up a slope if you're going fast enough, just like the 8-bit Sonic the Hedgehog titles.
The physics aren't going to be 100% accurate to them, but they feel very fluid and work fantastic.

Graphics are borrowed and modified from my first commercial project, Krystal the Adventurer.
